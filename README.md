# LawAreaClassificator
The goal of the project is the creation of a multi-class classificator using a BERT model. Using a sentence, details or facts as an input, this classificator predicts the law area in which it can be collocated. The dataset used to train the model is rcds/swiss_law_area_predictions from Hugging Face.
